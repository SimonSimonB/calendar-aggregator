* prototype a calendar extractor service
  * rename from 'smallest_div_...' to 'smallest_element_...' since you don't guarantee anymore that it is a div
  * make elphi test pass
    * option 1: extract not from smallest div with single date, but from largest div with single event?
    * option 2: always go up to the next li, if there is one, when you extract text
  * it might be better to filter out date strings only when you check whether the text is long enough to plausibly be an event, but not when you
  * get more websites to work

* if you have a good, robust extractor service, relegate the current website to /debug and write a nicer one
