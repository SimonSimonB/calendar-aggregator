* prototype a calendar extractor service
  * rename from 'smallest_div_...' to 'smallest_element_...' since you don't guarantee anymore that it is a div
  * only return events with date >= today (write test for that)
  * it might be better to filter out date strings only when you check whether the text is long enough to plausibly be an event, but not when you
  * get more websites to work 
    * https://www.staatsschauspiel-dresden.de/spielplan/monatsplan/
    * https://theater-hamburg.org/de_DE/spielplan?myprofile=false&category_system=from_file&date=28.08.2022
* if you have a good, robust extractor service, relegate the current website to /debug and write a nicer one

* further improvements to event extraction
  * make websites work with selenium
    * two tests for that already
  * can you leverage ul structures, where present?
